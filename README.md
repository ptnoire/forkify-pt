This is the final tutorial project I am doing before I set off to do all my own projects from scratch.

I really enjoyed this course as I learned to code, but by the end of it (70+ Hour Course) I found myself stopping the video and just coding the projects from flowcharts, only going back to find errors in my own code or to see if we coded the same way. The confidence this course and tutorial has given me can't be overstated, I am really grateful for it.

This project uses the teacher's own API to find recipes and display them in a nice formatted way as opposed to searching through the recipe websites which are often cluttered. The HTML / CSS were done by the teacher Jonas Schmedtmann, whose name you will see a lot on my older projects. All of the JavaScript was done by myself, you may of seen this project before because it is from a popular course on Udemy but mine will have some differences just because of the nature of me coding without the videos and doing it on my own, however; make no mistake it is because of this course that I gained the skill to do that.

I am making this note just so that anyone who happens to reads this knows that I am committing to doing my own projects from here on out and I am proud of how far I have come in such a short period of time. You're welcome to check out the website and it's features if your'e curious and I would love to discuss with anyone on why I chose to use certain functions / code in any of this.

And for anyone who is learning and is reading this, keep going friend! This has been a very rewarding journey and I remember not too long ago when looking at something like this seemed like it would be impossible to do myself but here we are.

Cheers - PT
